# Dual-Block-Feature-Fusion-Network-for-Autism-detection-
This study proposes a deep learning image classifier, that invloves dual-track feature fusion net
work architecture comprising Swin Transformer and customised Convolutional Neural
 Network (CNN) for enhanced classification accuracy between Autism Spectrum Disor
der (ASD) and Typical Development (TD), achieving a classification accuracy of 98.7%.
 Swin Transformers excel in capturing long-range dependencies within images, facilitat
ing a deeper understanding of interrelations among different image components. Con
currently, CNNs are adept at extracting local features, thus contributing to improved
 classification performance by considering both local and global features. In the second
 approach, a Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) is employed to classify features
 extracted from the feature fusion network. This model operates on a quantum simula
tor utilizing 16 qubits, achieving a classification accuracy of 96%. Notably, leveraging
 a quantum computer for feature classification could significantly accelerate predictions,
 thereby reducing computational time and improving the overall efficiency of the classi
fication.
